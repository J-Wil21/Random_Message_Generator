# Random Message Generator

## Why did I create this?

### This is a project to work on my programming skills. Also to practice my git command skills all uploads of files where done using git commands. From adding the files on the the stage to pushing into the github repo.

### Another reason for creating this repo is to collaborate with someone and get a small exposure of how it would be like to work within a team.

## How did I create the Random Message Generator

  - Created a HTML file with the approbate links to the app.js and style.css.
  - Gave a id to an empty div.
  - Within app.js
    * I create an array with words to use.
    * Created variables for the id messages and btn.
    * Created a random number generator from 0 to 29.
    * Added an "eventListener" to the button and gave it a function that would pick three words at random and show them once the button is clicked.
    * The 3 words would should with '-' separating them.

### I hope to improve this by adding CSS and better/advance functionality. I hope to collaborate with someone to help me improve this app.

# ðŸš€ Upcoming feature
[@Wayne](https://github.com/wgchasi) and [@Joshua](https://github.com/J-Wil21) will be collaborating to add the functionality of pulling and displaying words from an online database. In time, this will expand to become a password generator.

### We will be using [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs).
